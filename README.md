# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Horiseon requires a webpage that follows accessibility standards so that it is optimized for search engines. 

Refactoring this website with semantic HTML elements will allow other developers to understand the code more easiliy. The elements will follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. This also ensures accessability standards are met and optimized for search engines. 

Following accessability standards will allow users with disabilities to understand Horiseon's website with more ease.

After refactoring Horiseon's webpage I learned using semantic tags allows for a more concise and easier to read code. Semantic tags also allow the ability to merge CSS attributes for clearer code.
